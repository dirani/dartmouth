## Programming: Using Linux Tools and Libraries

We are thrilled to welcome you to the seventh and final course of the C Programming with Linux Professional Certificate offered by Dartmouth and IMT! If you have not already, we suggest you start with the first course, C Programming: Getting Started and then progress in order through the series.

In this seventh course you will learn to:

* Use external libraries
* Build an application from multiple source files
* Automate the building process using makefiles
* Pass and use arguments to the main function
* Read from and write to files in C
* Use professional building tools within the Linux operating system

Let’s get coding!
